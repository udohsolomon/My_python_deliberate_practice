# Goals
* Publish a blog post on **Bayesian Optimization** by Jan 1st, 2019

* Complete the [Algorithms Part 1] on Coursera by Jan 14th, 2019

* Complete my teaching materials **Problem Solving and Programming** for the next block starting Jan 14th, 2019

## Estimate Time Required To Achieve Goal

I will give myself the remaining part of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019 to work on these goals. It's only 2 weeks left until the end of 2018. 

**Timeframe**: One ongoing big project touching different stacks in Python by the end of 2018.

## Break Down Work Into A Day-by-day Schedule

* **Day1**: Started watching [BIDS Python bootcamp] videos. An introduction to numrical computing in Python, list, dictionary, strings, numpy, slicing, repeating and slicing, arrays and reading/writing to disk. Finally ended the day practice with working on the [Hubway dataset]
* **Day2**: Continued watching the BIDS Python bootcamp videos. Worked on the [Taxi pickups in NYC dataset]
